 abstract = {Connected cars are a rapidly growing segment of Internet of
Things (IoT). While they already use cellular networks to support emergency
response, in-car WiFi hotspots and infotainment, there is also a push
towards updating their firmware over-the-air (FOTA). With millions of
connected cars expected to be deployed over the next several years, and
more importantly persist in the network for a long time, it is important
to understand their behavior, usage patterns, and impact - both in
terms of their experience, as well as other users. Using one million
connected cars on a production cellular network, we conduct network-scale
measurements of over one billion radio connections to understand various
aspects including their spatial and temporal connectivity patterns, the
network conditions they face, use and handovers across various radio
frequencies and mobility patterns. Our measurement study reveals that
connected cars have distinct sets of characteristics, including those
similar to regular smartphones (e.g. overall diurnal pattern), those
similar to IoT devices (e.g. mostly short network sessions), but also
some that belong to neither type (e.g. high mobility). These insights are
invaluable in understanding and modeling connected cars in a cellular
network and in designing strategies to manage their data demand.},
