  abstract = {Connected cars are a rapidly growing segment of Internet of
    Things (IoT). While they already use cellular networks to support emergency
    response, in-car WiFi hotspots and infotainment, there is also a push
    towards updating their firmware over-the-air (FOTA). With millions of
    connected cars expected to be deployed over the next several years, and
    more importantly persist in the network for a long time, it is important
    to understand their behavior, usage patterns, and impact - both in
    terms of their experience, as well as other users. Using one million
    connected cars on a production cellular network, we conduct network-scale
    measurements of over one billion radio connections to understand various
    aspects including their spatial and temporal connectivity patterns, the
    network conditions they face, use and handovers across various radio
    frequencies and mobility patterns. Our measurement study reveals that
    connected cars have distinct sets of characteristics, including those
    similar to regular smartphones (e.g. overall diurnal pattern), those
    similar to IoT devices (e.g. mostly short network sessions), but also
    some that belong to neither type (e.g. high mobility). These insights are
    invaluable in understanding and modeling connected cars in a cellular
    network and in designing strategies to manage their data demand.},
