 abstract = {In this work, we introduce the Flowshop Scheduling Problem with
Delivery Dates and Cumulative Payoffs. This problem is a variation of the
flowshop scheduling problem with job release dates that maximizes the
total payoff with a stepwise job objective function. This paper
contributes towards proposing a mathematical formulation for this new
problem and an original constructive heuristic. Additionally, we develop
a new benchmark of 300 hard instances which are available in a public
repository. Besides, we provide primal and dual bounds for them.
Extensive computational experiments were carried out taking into account
classical constructive heuristics and hybrid local searches. Results show
the merit of the FF heuristic when compared to other classical heuristics
for flowshop scheduling problems. Additionally, we compare an Iterated
Local Search (ILS), an Iterated Greedy Search (IGS), and a Biased
Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), both customized for the studied
problem, and a commercial mixed integer programming solver. The
comparison between these methods showed that the BRKGA starting with
a solution from FF heuristic is able to find the best solutions in a
very short period of time. Iterated local Search and the commercial
solver presented significantly worse results than the aforementioned
methods.},
