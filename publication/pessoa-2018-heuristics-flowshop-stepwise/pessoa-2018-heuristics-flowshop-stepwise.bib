  abstract = {In this work, we introduce the Flowshop Scheduling Problem with
    Delivery Dates and Cumulative Payoffs. This problem is a variation of the
    flowshop scheduling problem with job release dates that maximizes the
    total payoff with a stepwise job objective function. This paper
    contributes towards proposing a mathematical formulation for this new
    problem and an original constructive heuristic. Additionally, we develop
    a new benchmark of 300 hard instances which are available in a public
    repository. Besides, we provide primal and dual bounds for them.
    Extensive computational experiments were carried out taking into account
    classical constructive heuristics and hybrid local searches. Results show
    the merit of the FF heuristic when compared to other classical heuristics
    for flowshop scheduling problems. Additionally, we compare an Iterated
    Local Search (ILS), an Iterated Greedy Search (IGS), and a Biased
    Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), both customized for the studied
    problem, and a commercial mixed integer programming solver. The
    comparison between these methods showed that the BRKGA starting with
    a solution from FF heuristic is able to find the best solutions in a
    very short period of time. Iterated local Search and the commercial
    solver presented significantly worse results than the aforementioned
    methods.},
