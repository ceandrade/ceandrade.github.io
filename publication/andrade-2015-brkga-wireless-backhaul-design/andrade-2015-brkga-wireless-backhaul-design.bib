  abstract = {This paper describes a biased random-key genetic algorithm for a
    real-world wireless backhaul network design problem. This is a novel
    problem, closely related to variants of the Steiner tree problem and the
    facility location problem. Given a parameter h, we want to build a forest
    where each tree has at most h hops from the demand nodes, where traffic
    originates, to the root nodes where each tree is rooted. Candidate
    Steiner nodes do not have any demand but represent locations where we can
    install cellsites to cover the traffic and equipment to backhaul the
    traffic to the cellular core network. Each Steiner node can cover demand
    nodes within a given distance, subject to a capacity constraint. The
    aggregate set of constraints may make it impossible to cover or backhaul
    all demands. A revenue function computes the revenue associated with the
    total amount of traffic covered and backhauled to the root nodes. The
    objective of the problem is to build a forest that maximizes the
    difference between the total revenue and the cost associated with the
    installed equipment. Although we will have a forest when we consider only
    the backhaul links and root nodes, the addition of demand vertices can
    induce undirected cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graph. We
    consider instances of this problem with several additional constraints
    that are motivated by the requirements of real-world telecommunication
    networks.},
