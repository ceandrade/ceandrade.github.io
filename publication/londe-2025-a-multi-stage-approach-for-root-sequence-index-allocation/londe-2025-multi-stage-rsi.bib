  abstract = {The Root Sequence Index (RSI) is a parameter used in mobile
    wireless networks to allocate uplink channels between user equipment and
    base stations. Inadequate RSI assignment to neighbor radios may lead to
    failure in service establishment and performance degradation. Wireless
    networks are also dynamic, with uncertain modifications in time due to,
    for instance, seasonal foliage. In this paper, we model RSI allocation with
    seasonal changes in the network as a multistage robust problem, being the
    first proactive, look-ahead method to consider uncertainty in RSI
    assignments. We develop methods to solve this stochastic problem,
    aiming to minimize the possible interference and network changes in
    time. A mixed-integer programming model, a classic Biased Random-Key
    Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), and a novel BRKGA hybridized with
    Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm are explored and compared. We also introduce a
    Monte Carlo-based simulation methodology to obtain scenarios. The
    hybrid BRKGA-based approach is shown to obtain more robust solutions
    in shorter computational times.
