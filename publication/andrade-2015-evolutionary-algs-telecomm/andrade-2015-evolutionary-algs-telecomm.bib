 abstract = {In last twenty years, telecommunication networks have experienced
a huge increase in data utilization. From massive on-demand video to
uncountable mobile devices exchanging text and video, traffic reached
scales that overcame the network capacities. Therefore, telecommunication
companies around the world have been forced to increase their capacity to
serve this increasing demand. As the cost to deploy network
infrastructure is usually very large, the design of a network heavily
uses optimization tools to keep costs as low as possible. In this thesis,
we analyze several aspects of the design and deployment of communication
networks.},
