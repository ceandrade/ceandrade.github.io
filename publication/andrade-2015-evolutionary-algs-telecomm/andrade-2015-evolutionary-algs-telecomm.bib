  abstract = {In last twenty years, telecommunication networks have experienced
    a huge increase in data utilization. From massive on-demand video to
    uncountable mobile devices exchanging text and video, traffic reached
    scales that overcame the network capacities. Therefore, telecommunication
    companies around the world have been forced to increase their capacity to
    serve this increasing demand. As the cost to deploy network infrastructure
    is usually very large, the design of a network heavily uses optimization
    tools to keep costs as low as possible. In this thesis, we analyze several
    aspects of the design and deployment of communication networks.},
