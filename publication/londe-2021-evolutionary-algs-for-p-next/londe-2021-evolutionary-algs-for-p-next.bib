  abstract = {The p-next center problem is an extension of the classical
    p-center problem, in which a backup center must be assigned to welcome
      users from a suddenly unavailable center. Usually, users tend to seek
      help in the closest facility they can find. However, during a significant
      event or crisis, one only realizes that the closest facility has been
      disrupted upon his/her arrival. Therefore, the user seeks help in the
      next closest center from the one that has failed to provide service.
      Therefore, the objective of the p-next center problem is to minimize the
      path of any user, which is made by the distance from this origin to its
      closest installed facility, plus the distance from this facility to its
      backup. We propose an evolutionary approach for the p-next center problem
      and an extension for the current benchmark instances. The proposed
      methods are built on the Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm
      with Implicit Path-Relinking. Computational experiments carried out on
      416 test instances show, experimentally, the outstanding performance of
      the developed algorithms and their flexibility to reach a good
      quality-speed trade-off.},
