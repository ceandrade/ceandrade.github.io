  abstract = {The p-next center problem is an extension of the classical
    p-center problem, in which a backup center must be assigned to welcome
    users from a suddenly unavailable center. Usually, users tend to seek help
    in the closest facility they can find. However, during a significant event
    or crisis, one only realizes that the closest facility has been disrupted
    upon his/her arrival. Therefore, the user seeks help in the next closest
    center from the one that has failed to provide service.  Therefore,
    the objective of the p-next center problem is to minimize the path of
    any user, which is made by the distance from this origin to its closest
    installed facility, plus the distance from this facility to its backup.
    We propose an evolutionary approach for the p-next center problem and
    an extension for the current benchmark instances. The proposed methods
    are built on the Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with
    Implicit Path-Relinking. Computational experiments carried out on 416 test
    instances show, experimentally, the outstanding performance of the
    developed algorithms and their flexibility to reach a good quality-speed
    trade-off.
