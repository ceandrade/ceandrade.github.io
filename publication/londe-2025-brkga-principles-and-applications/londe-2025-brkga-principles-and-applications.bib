  abstract  = {A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic
    for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector
    of n random keys, where a random key is a real number randomly generated
    in the continuous interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random
    keys to a solution of the optimization problem being solved and
    computes its cost. The benefit of this approach is that all genetic
    operators and transformations can be maintained within the unitary
    hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This enhances the
    productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The algorithm
    starts with a population of p vectors of random keys. At each
    iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of
    high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All
    elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A
    small number of random-key vectors (the mutants) are added to the
    population of the next iteration. The remaining elements of the
    population of the next iteration are generated by combining, with the
    parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong (On the virtues of
    parameterized uniform crossover. In: Proceedings of the Fourth
    International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, pp 230--236, 1991),
    pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key
    genetic algorithms and describes an effective variant
    called biased random-key genetic algorithms.},
