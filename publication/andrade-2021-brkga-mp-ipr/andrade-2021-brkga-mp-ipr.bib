  abstract = {In this paper, we present the Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key
  Genetic Algorithm with Implicit Path-Relinking (BRKGA-MP-IPR), a variant of
  the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm that employs multiple (biased)
  parents to generate offspring instead of the usual two, and is hybridized
  with a novel, implicit path-relinking local search procedure. By operating
  over the standard unit hypercube, such path-relinking mechanism leverages
  the population representation of the BRKGA and thus provides complete
  independence between the local search procedure and the problem definition
  and implementation. This approach contrasts with traditional path-relinking
  procedures that are tied to the problem structure. Having both BRKGA and
  IPR operate over the same solution space not only makes the
  intensification/diversification paradigm more natural but also greatly
  simplifies the development effort from the perspective of the practitioner,
  as one only needs to develop a decoder to map unit random-key vectors to
  the solution space of the problem on hand. Apart from such key benefits,
  extensive computational experiments solving real-world problems, such as
  over-the-air software upgrade scheduling, network design problems, and
  combinatorial auctions, show that the BRKGA-MP-IPR offers performance
  benefits over the standard BRKGA as well as the BRKGA with multiple
  parents.},
