  abstract = {The School Timetabling Problem (STP) aims to allocate subjects to
    specific times for viable planning while avoiding scheduling conflicts
    between professors, classes, and other resources. We observed this
    problem in a higher education institution and, to solve it, implemented
    the genetic algorithm (GA) and variants RKGA (Random-Key Genetic
    Algorithm) and BRKGA (Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm). Different
    parameterizations were experimented with using real data. We compare the
    developed methods considering criteria such as the quality of the
    solutions and execution time. The results show that BRKGA obtained
    feasible schedules and better quality solutions than RKGA in 76.67\% of
    the cases and all cases compared to GA.},
