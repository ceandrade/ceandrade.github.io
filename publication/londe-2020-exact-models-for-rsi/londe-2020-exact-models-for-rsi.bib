  abstract = {Since its introduction, mobile wireless communication has grown
  and changed substantially. This massive growth leads to different levels of
  complexity, mainly concerned with the assignment of different parameters to
  antennas or base stations. One parameter is the Root Sequence Index (RSI),
  related to the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) preambles, used to
  allocate uplink channels between the user equipment and the base station.
  The assignment of RSIs close-in-range to neighbor antennas may cause
  collisions, which are responsible for failures on service establishment,
  and therefore, performance degradation. Such allocation problems can be
  modeled as Graph Coloring Problems, including several additional
  constraints. However, few studies focus on RSI allocation and collisions
  from the optimization perspective. The objective of this study is to
  develop a method for allocating the RSI, trying to lessen the risk of
  collision and obeying other constraints. In this paper, we introduce an
  exact model for this problem alongside several instances extracted from a
  large carrier.},
