  abstract = {We investigate a variant of the many-to-many hub location‐routing
    problem which consists in partitioning the set of nodes of a graph into
    routes containing exactly one hub each, and determining an extra route
    interconnecting all hubs. A variable neighborhood descent with
    neighborhood structures based on remove/add, swap and exchange moves
    nested with routing and location operations is used as a local search
    procedure in a multistart algorithm. We also consider a sequential
    version of this local search in the multistart. In addition, a biased
    random‐key genetic algorithm working with a local search routine, which
    also considers routing and location operations, is applied to the
    problem. To compare the heuristic solutions, we develop an integer
    programming formulation which is solved with a branch‐and‐cut algorithm.
    Capacity and path elimination constraints are added in a cutting plane
    fashion. The separation algorithms are based on the computation of
    min‐cut trees and on the connected components of a support graph.
    Computational experiments were conducted on several benchmark instances
    of routing problems and show that the heuristics are effective on medium
    to large‐sized instances, while the branch‐and‐cut algorithm solves small
    to medium sized problems to optimality. These algorithms were also
    compared with a commercial hybrid solver showing that the heuristics are
    quite competitive.},
