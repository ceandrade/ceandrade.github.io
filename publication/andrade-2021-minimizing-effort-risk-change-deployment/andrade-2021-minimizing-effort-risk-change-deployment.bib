  abstract = {Networks undergo continuous changes to introduce new services
    and improve existing ones. Network change deployment involves carefully
    deciding when each change activity will be executed and who will be
    executing the change. This is a complex process because each service
    group has to plan its activities following a set of operational and
    technological constraints. Besides, multiple groups may be working on the
    same or dependent nodes at the same time, and they must co-ordinate their
    deployment plans. If they do not co-ordinate, conflicting change
    execution could result in unexpected impacts. Traditionally, change
    deployment has been a tedious and time-consuming task. To address this,
    we propose an innovative solution Zapper that aims for minimal human effort
    to coordinate the changes, minimal risk to service quality, and efficient
    plans to rapidly deploy the changes. Zapper maps change scheduling
    constraints into mathematical equations and then uses optimization
    algorithms to generate conflict-free change plans that satisfy all
    constraints across service groups. We have deployed Zapper at a large
    service provider and it is being used regularly by the network operations
    teams for more than two years to schedule over 4.5 million change
    activities.}
