  abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of picking a subset of bids
    in a general combinatorial auction so as to maximize the overall profit
    using the first-price model. This winner determination problem assumes
    that a single bidding round is held to determine both the winners and
    prices to be paid. We introduce six variants of biased random-key genetic
    algorithms for this problem. Three of them use a novel initialization
    technique that makes use of solutions of intermediate linear programming
    relaxations of an exact mixed integer linear programming model as initial
    chromosomes of the population. An experimental evaluation compares the
    effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with the standard mixed linear
    integer programming formulation, a specialized exact algorithm, and the
    best-performing heuristics proposed for this problem. The proposed
    algorithms are competitive and offer strong results, mainly for
    large-scale auctions.},
