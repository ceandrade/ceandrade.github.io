 abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of picking a subset of bids
in a general combinatorial auction so as to maximize the overall profit
using the first-price model. This winner determination problem assumes
that a single bidding round is held to determine both the winners and
prices to be paid. We introduce six variants of biased random-key genetic
algorithms for this problem. Three of them use a novel initialization
technique that makes use of solutions of intermediate linear programming
relaxations of an exact mixed integer linear programming model as initial
chromosomes of the population. An experimental evaluation compares the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with the standard mixed linear
integer programming formulation, a specialized exact algorithm, and the
best-performing heuristics proposed for this problem. The proposed
algorithms are competitive and offer strong results, mainly for
large-scale auctions.},
