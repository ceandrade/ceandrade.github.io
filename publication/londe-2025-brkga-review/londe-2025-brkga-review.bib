  abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive literature review of Biased
    Random-Key Genetic Algorithms (BRKGA). BRKGA is a metaheuristic that
      employs random-key-based chromosomes with biased, uniform, and elitist
      mating strategies in a genetic algorithm framework. The review
      encompasses over 150 papers with a wide range of applications, including
      classical combinatorial optimization problems, real-world industrial use
      cases, and non-orthodox applications such as neural network
      hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. Scheduling is by far the most
      prevalent application area in this review, followed by network design and
      location problems. The most frequent hybridization method employed is
      local search, and new features aim to increase population diversity. We
      also detail challenges and future directions for this method. Overall,
      this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the BRKGA metaheuristic
      and its applications and highlights important areas for future research.
