  abstract = {We consider the problem of managing Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA)
    updates for cars at a massive scale over a cellular network. This problem
    is constrained by factors like large number of cars, a need to perform
    updates quickly and securely, ability to do the update anywhere and any
    time, and delivering the often large update without harming the network.
    We present a scheduling approach for managing large FOTA downloads in a
    cellular network that combines historical network load with car usage and
    location analytics. The proposed approach uses a combination of
    heuristics and an optimized scheduler and applies them to schedule the
    admission of cars to download FOTA. Using real network data from a large
    cellular provider that includes a million cars and nearly a billion
    radio-level network connections, we show that our scheduling approach is
    feasible and practical. We also show that it is possible to manage FOTA
    even when device and network models use high levels of aggregation over
    time. Simulation results show that our method improves over random
    uncontrolled approaches by (i) reducing median download startup delay by
    48\%, (ii) reducing the number of cars that don't complete the update by
    10\% and most importantly, (iii) reducing the load in busy cells by up to
    37\%.},
