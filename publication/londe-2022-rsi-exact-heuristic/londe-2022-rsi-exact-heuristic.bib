  abstract = {In mobile wireless networks, the Root Sequence Index (RSI) is
    used to allocate uplink channels between the user equipment and the base
    station. The assignment of RSIs close-in-range to neighbor radios may
    cause collisions leading to failures on service establishment and
    performance degradation. In this study, we model the RSI allocation as a
    generalization of the classical Graph Coloring Problem, indicating that
    there must be a minimum distance for the assigned colors of two
    neighbors. For the RSI allocation, a maximal distance is also needed. We
    develop methods for allocating the RSI, while minimizing the risk of
    collisions, for two different operation modes found on carrier-grade
    networks. Both exact and heuristic methods are explored and compared. We
    test the proposed approaches on instances obtained from real-life context.
