  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review and
    bibliometric analysis focusing on Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms
      (BRKGA). BRKGA is a metaheuristic framework that uses random-key-based
      chromosomes with biased, uniform, and elitist mating strategies alongside
      a genetic algorithm. This review encompasses around 250 papers, covering
      a diverse array of applications ranging from classical combinatorial
      optimization problems to real-world industrial scenarios, and even
      non-traditional applications like hyperparameter tuning in machine
      learning and scenario generation for two-stage problems. In summary, this
      study offers a comprehensive examination of the BRKGA metaheuristic and
      its various applications, shedding light on key areas for future
      research.
