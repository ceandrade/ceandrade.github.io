 abstract = {We investigate a variant of the many-to-many (hub)
location-routing problem, which consists in partitioning the set of
vertices of a graph into cycles containing exactly one hub each, and
determining an extra cycle interconnecting all hubs. A local search
heuristic that considers add/remove and swap operations is
developed.Also, a branch-and-cut approach that solves an integer
formulation is investigated.Computational experiments on several
instances adapted from literature show that our algorithms are good to
deal with small to medium-sized instances.},
