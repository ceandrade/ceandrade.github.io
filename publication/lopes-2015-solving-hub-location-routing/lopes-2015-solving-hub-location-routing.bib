  abstract = {We investigate a variant of the many-to-many (hub)
    location-routing problem, which consists in partitioning the set of
    vertices of a graph into cycles containing exactly one hub each, and
    determining an extra cycle interconnecting all hubs. A local search
    heuristic that considers add/remove and swap operations is
    developed.Also, a branch-and-cut approach that solves an integer
    formulation is investigated.Computational experiments on several
    instances adapted from literature show that our algorithms are good to
    deal with small to medium-sized instances.},
