  abstract = {In mobile wireless networks, the Root Sequence Index (RSI) is
      used to allocate uplink channels between the user equipment and the base
      station. The assignment of RSIs close-in-range to neighbor radios may
      cause collisions leading to failures on service establishment and
      performance degradation.  In this paper, we model the RSI allocation as a
      generalization of the classical Graph Coloring Problem, indicating that
      there must be a minimum distance for the assigned colors of two
      neighbors. For the RSI allocation, a maximal distance is also needed.
      We develop methods for allocating the RSI, while minimizing the risk of
      collisions, for two different operation modes found on carrier-grade
      networks.  Both exact and heuristic methods are explored and compared. 
      We test the proposed approaches on instances obtained from real-life
      context.
