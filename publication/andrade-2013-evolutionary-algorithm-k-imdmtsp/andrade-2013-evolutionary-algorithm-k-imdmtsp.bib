 abstract = {We introduce the $k$-Interconnected Multi-Depot Multi-Traveling
Salesmen Problem, a new problem that resembles some network design and
location routing problems but carries the inherent difficulty of not
having a fixed set of depots or terminals. We propose a heuristic based
on a biased random-key genetic algorithm to solve it. This heuristic uses
local search procedures to best choose the terminal vertices and improve
the tours of a given solution. We compare our heuristic with a
multi-start procedure using the same local improvements and we show that
the proposed algorithm is competitive.},
