  abstract = {We introduce the $k$-Interconnected Multi-Depot Multi-Traveling
    Salesmen Problem, a new problem that resembles some network design and
    location routing problems but carries the inherent difficulty of not
    having a fixed set of depots or terminals. We propose a heuristic based
    on a biased random-key genetic algorithm to solve it. This heuristic uses
    local search procedures to best choose the terminal vertices and improve
    the tours of a given solution. We compare our heuristic with a
    multi-start procedure using the same local improvements and we show that
    the proposed algorithm is competitive.},
