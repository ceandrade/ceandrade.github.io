  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose two new variants of the Biased
    Random-Key Genetic Algorithm.  In the first, the algorithm assigns a gender
    to each chromosome and only allows crossover between chromosomes of
    different gender. In the second variant, more than two parents are used
    to generate a new offspring. Computational experiments are conducted on
    instances of set covering and set packing problems. We empirically show
    that the multi-parent modification is able to overcome the original
    biased random-key genetic algorithm although it requires slightly more
    time and iterations to converge.},
