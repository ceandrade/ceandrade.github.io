  abstract  = {In Overlapping Correlation Clustering (OCC), a number of objects
    are assigned to clusters. Two objects in the same cluster have correlated
    characteristics. As opposed to traditional clustering where objects are
    assigned to a single cluster, in OCC objects may be assigned to one or
    more clusters. In this paper, we present Biased Random-Key Genetic
    Algorithms for OCC. We present computational experiments such results
    outperformed the state of art methods for OCC.},
