 abstract = {In Overlapping Correlation Clustering (OCC), a number of objects
are assigned to clusters. Two objects in the same cluster have correlated
characteristics. As opposed to traditional clustering where objects are
assigned to a single cluster, in OCC objects may be assigned to one or
more clusters. In this paper, we present Biased Random-Key Genetic
Algorithms for OCC. We present computational experiments such results
outperformed the state of art methods for OCC.},
