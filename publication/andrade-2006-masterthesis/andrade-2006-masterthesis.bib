 abstract = {Cutting and packing problems are common problems that occur in
many industry and business process. Their optimized resolution leads to
great profits in several sectors. A common problem, that occur in textile
and paper industries, is to cut a strip of some material to obtain
several small items, using the minimum length of material. This problem,
known by Two Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2SP), is a hard
combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we present an exact
algorithm to 2SP, restricted to two staged cuts (known by Two Dimensional
Level Strip Packing, 2LSP). The algorithm uses the branch-and-price
technique, and heuristics based on approximation algorithms to obtain
upper bounds. The algorithm obtained optimal or almost optimal for small
and moderate sized instances.},
