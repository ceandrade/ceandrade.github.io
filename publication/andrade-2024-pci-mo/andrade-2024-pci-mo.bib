  abstract = {The Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter to
      radio access networks used by the user equipment, like a smartphone, to
      identify the cell to connect. The PCI misassignment leads to call drops,
      no voice/data connections, and other sorts of impairments. Many works in
      the literature only treat the PCI assignment problem from the
      technological constraints viewpoint. In this work, we take a realistic
      approach and incorporate several operational constraints found daily in
      carrier-grade networks. For that, we model the problem with multiple
      objectives with a strict lexicographical dominance relation. We solve it
      using a hybrid memetic algorithm with warm start solutions obtained by a
      constraint programming solver and intensification with path-relinking and
      custom local search procedures. The experimental results suggest that our
      approach is superior to commercial solver packages in several scenarios.
