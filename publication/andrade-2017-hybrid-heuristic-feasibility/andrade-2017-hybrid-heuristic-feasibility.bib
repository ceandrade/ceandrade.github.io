  abstract = {We present a new framework for finding feasible solutions to
    mixed integer programs (MIP). We use the feasibility pump heuristic coupled
    to a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). The feasibility pump
    heuristic attempts to find a feasible solution to a MIP by first rounding
    a solution to the linear programming (LP) relaxation to an integer (but
    not necessarily feasible) solution and then projecting it to a
    feasible solution to the LP relaxation. The BRKGA is able to build a pool
    of projected and rounded but not necessarily feasible solutions and to
    combine them using information from previous projections. This
    information is also used to fix variables during the process to speed up
    the solution of the LP relaxations, and to reduce the problem size in
    enumeration phases. Experimental results show that this approach is able
    to find feasible solutions for instances where the original feasibility
    pump or a commercial mixed integer programming solver often fail.},
