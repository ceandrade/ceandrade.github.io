  abstract  = {This paper introduces a novel problem of facility location,
    called the p-next center problem with capacity and coverage radius
    constraints. We formulate a mixed integer programming model for this
    problem, and compare the results found by CPLEX with three Biased
    Random-Key Genetic Algorithms variants. We also propose several instances
    for this problem, based on existing ones for the p-next center problem.
    Additionally, we analyze the effect of the radius and demand on
    instance difficulty. We also observe the performance gains with a
    relaxed capacity and demand constraint, i.e., permitting demand to be
    unmet by the model. Results point that the BRKGA variants had
    significantly better performance than CPLEX, and similar performances
    among themselves. Of those, BRKGA-FI was shown to have slightly
    better results than the other variants.},
