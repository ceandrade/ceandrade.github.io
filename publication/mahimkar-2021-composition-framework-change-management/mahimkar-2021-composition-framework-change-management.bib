  abstract  = {Change management has been a long-standing challenge for network
    operations. The large scale and diversity of networks, their complex
      dependencies, and continuous evolution through technology and software
      updates combined with the risk of service impact create tremendous
      challenges to effectively manage changes. In this paper, we use data from
      a large service provider and experiences of their operations teams to
      highlight the need for quick and easy adaptation of change management
      capabilities and keep up with the continuous network changes. We propose
      a new framework CORNET (COmposition fRamework for chaNge managEmenT) with
      key ideas of modularization of changes into building blocks, flexible
      composition into change workflows, change plan optimization, change
      impact verification, and automated translation of high-level change
      management intent into low-level implementations and mathematical models.
      We demonstrate the effectiveness of CORNET using real-world data
      collected from 4G and 5G cellular networks and virtualized services such
      as VPN and SDWAN running in the cloud as well as experiments conducted on
      a testbed of virtualized network functions. We also share our operational
      experiences and lessons learned from successfully using CORNET within a
      large service provider network over the last three years.},
