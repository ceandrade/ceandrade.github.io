By operating over the standard unit hypercube, such path-relinking mechanism leverages the population representation of the BRKGA and thus provides complete independence between the local search procedure and the problem definition and implementation. This approach contrasts with traditional path-relinking procedures that are tied to the problem structure. Having both BRKGA and IPR operate over the same solution space not only makes the intensification/diversification paradigm more natural but also greatly simplifies the development effort from the perspective of the practitioner, as one only needs to develop a decoder to map unit random-key vectors to the solution space of the problem on hand. Apart from such key benefits, extensive computational experiments solving real-world problems, such as over-the-air software upgrade scheduling, network design problems, and combinatorial auctions, show that the BRKGA-MP-IPR offers performance benefits over the standard BRKGA as well as the BRKGA with multiple parents.","tags":["Genetic Algorithms","Path-relinking algorithms","Hybrid heuristics"],"title":"The Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with Implicit Path-Relinking and its real-world applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

In the TMDSP, jobs, machine utilization, and production rates vary over time. In each period, a given job can be executed by a subset of machines with different capacities and production rates. The objective is to deploy a feasible schedule with minimum total completion time.  We explore solving the problem using several approaches among than Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), Simulating Annealing (SA), two variations of Tabu Search (TB), and traditional genetic algorithms (TGA), in addition to a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model.  We test the proposed approaches on a synthetic benchmark and very large real instances in IoT space. While using a commercial solver and the MIP model, we are able to solve only a few real instances (with, at most, 1,976 cars and 9,116 sectors); on the other hand, BRKGA presents significantly better results when compared to ILS, MIP solver and a simple multi-start heuristic.","tags":["Connected Cars","Internet of Things","IoT","Scheduling","Time- and Machine-Dependent Scheduling","Biased random-key genetic algorithm"],"title":"Scheduling software updates for connected cars with limited availability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

Our measurement study reveals that connected cars have distinct sets of characteristics, including those similar to regular smartphones (e.g. overall diurnal pattern), those similar to IoT devices (e.g. mostly short network sessions), but also some that belong to neither type (e.g. high mobility).

Using real network data from a large cellular provider that includes a million cars and nearly a billion radio-level network connections, we show that our scheduling approach is feasible and practical. We also show that it is possible to manage FOTA even when device and network models use high levels of aggregation over time.

This is a novel problem, closely related to variants of the Steiner tree problem and the facility location problem. Given a parameter h, we want to build a forest where each tree has at most h hops from the demand nodes, where traffic originates, to the root nodes where each tree is rooted. Candidate Steiner nodes do not have any demand but represent locations where we can install cellsites to cover the traffic and equipment to backhaul the traffic to the cellular core network. Each Steiner node can cover demand nodes within a given distance, subject to a capacity constraint. The aggregate set of constraints may make it impossible to cover or backhaul all demands. A revenue function computes the revenue associated with the total amount of traffic covered and backhauled to the root nodes. The objective of the problem is to build a forest that maximizes the difference between the total revenue and the cost associated with the installed equipment. Although we will have a forest when we consider only the backhaul links and root nodes, the addition of demand vertices can induce undirected cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graph. We consider instances of this problem with several additional constraints that are motivated by the requirements of real-world telecommunication networks.","tags":["Wireless backhaul network design","Small cells","Genetic algorithm","Mixed integer programming model"],"title":"A biased random-key genetic algorithm for wireless backhaul network design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

This winner determination problem assumes that a single bidding round is held to determine both the winners and prices to be paid. We introduce six variants of biased random-key genetic algorithms for this problem. Three of them use a novel initialization technique that makes use of solutions of intermediate linear programming relaxations of an exact mixed integer linear programming model as initial chromosomes of the population. An experimental evaluation compares the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with the standard mixed linear integer programming formulation, a specialized exact algorithm, and the best-performing heuristics proposed for this problem. The proposed algorithms are competitive and offer strong results, mainly for large-scale auctions.","tags":["Combinatorial auctions","Winner determination proble","Genetic algorithms","Biased random-key genetic algorithms"],"title":"Biased random-key genetic algorithms for the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Eduardo de Andrade"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420088400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562075993,"objectID":"49ba4f5db0852f19e33b708fc8dd8a42","permalink":"https://ceandrade.github.io/publication/andrade-2015-evolutionary-algs-telecomm/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/andrade-2015-evolutionary-algs-telecomm/","section":"publication","summary":"In last twenty years, telecommunication networks have experienced a huge increase in data utilization. From massive on-demand video to uncountable mobile devices exchanging text and video, traffic reached scales that overcame the network capacities. Therefore, telecommunication companies around the world have been forced to increase their capacity to serve this increasing demand. As the cost to deploy network infrastructure is usually very large, the design of a network heavily uses optimization tools to keep costs as low as possible. In this thesis, we analyze several aspects of the design and deployment of communication networks.","tags":["Combinatorial Optimization","Network Design","Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms"],"title":"Evolutionary Algorithms for some Problems in Telecommunications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mauro C.

Their optimized resolution leads to great profits in several sectors. A common problem, that occur in textile and paper industries, is to cut a strip of some material to obtain several small items, using the minimum length of material. This problem, known by Two Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2SP), is a hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we present an exact algorithm to 2SP, restricted to two staged cuts (known by Two Dimensional Level Strip Packing, 2LSP). The algorithm uses the branch-and-price technique, and heuristics based on approximation algorithms to obtain upper bounds. The algorithm obtained optimal or almost optimal for small and moderate sized instances.","tags":["Cut and Packing Problem","Branch-and-Price","Column Generation"],"title":"Um algoritmo exato para o Problema de Empacotamento Bidimensional em Faixas","type":"publication"}]
