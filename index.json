In this work, we take a realistic approach and incorporate several operational constraints found daily in carrier-grade networks. For that, we model the problem with multiple objectives with a strict lexicographical dominance relation. We solve it using a hybrid memetic algorithm with warm start solutions obtained by a constraint programming solver and intensification with path-relinking and custom local search procedures.

They can be produced through tens of synthesis methods and post-synthesis processing steps tuned each at specific conditions (e.g., temperature, time, and chemicals concentration). To achieve a “rational design” platform for a system with a high dimensional parameter space such as CFMs, we processed 10,975 scientific articles (from years 2000 to 2020) related to the subject with automatic reading-interpreting-extracting computational routines (namely a.RIX engine). The a.RIX engine automatically recognized more than a hundred precursors, among which wheat straw, rice husk, and rice straw were the most studied for CFMs synthesis and application in agriculture (e.g., as an amendment), as a fuel (energy generation), and as an adsorbent. Parameters related to the CFMs synthesis conditions such as carbonization temperature and time, and parameters related to CFMs properties such as surface area and heavy metals adsorption capacity, can also be extracted from the articles. Correlations between the CFMs precursors and synthesis conditions indicated very little statistical difference between the carbonization temperature and time used for the CFMs synthesis from different precursors. Essentially, precursors are carbonized at temperatures varying from 100 to 900 oC for 30 min to six hours using pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, and gasification. When focusing the analysis just on CFMs produced by pyrolysis (biochar), we observed that peanut shells can produce materials with higher surface areas than other precursors (p “activation” - “drying” - “ashing” - “washing” - “filtration.” With this approach, we show that a non-computational review of scientific articles for materials with a huge parameter space such as CFMs is largely obsolete. Finally, taken together, the results provide a powerful platform for data-oriented experimental design of CFMs produced from biomass.","tags":["Machine learning","Natural language processing","Nanotechnology","Carbon materials","Biochar","Hydrochar"],"title":"Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Enable a Data-Oriented Experimental Design Approach for Producing Biochar and Hydrochar from Biomass","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Yuan","Yuning Yang","Carlos E.

Usually, users tend to seek help in the closest facility they can find. However, during a significant event or crisis, one only realizes that the closest facility has been disrupted upon his/her arrival. Therefore, the user seeks help in the next closest center from the one that has failed to provide service. Therefore, the objective of the p-next center problem is to minimize the path of any user, which is made by the distance from this origin to its closest installed facility, plus the distance from this facility to its backup. We propose an evolutionary approach for the p-next center problem and an extension for the current benchmark instances.

Network change deployment involves carefully deciding when each change activity will be executed and who will be executing the change. This is a complex process because each service group has to plan its activities following a set of operational and technological constraints. Besides, multiple groups may be working on the same or dependent nodes at the same time, and they must co-ordinate their deployment plans. If they do not co-ordinate, conflicting change execution could result in unexpected impacts. Traditionally, change deployment has been a tedious and time-consuming task. To address this, we propose an innovative solution Zapper that aims for minimal human effort to coordinate the changes, minimal risk to service quality, and efficient plans to rapidly deploy the changes. Zapper maps change scheduling constraints into mathematical equations and then uses optimization algorithms to generate conflict-free change plans that satisfy all constraints across service groups. We have deployed Zapper at a large service provider and it is being used regularly by the network operations teams for more than two years to schedule over 4.5 million change activities.","tags":["Change management","Combinatorial optimization","Scheduling problems"],"title":"Minimizing Effort and Risk with Network Change Deployment Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lien K.

By operating over the standard unit hypercube, such path-relinking mechanism leverages the population representation of the BRKGA and thus provides complete independence between the local search procedure and the problem definition and implementation. This approach contrasts with traditional path-relinking procedures that are tied to the problem structure. Having both BRKGA and IPR operate over the same solution space not only makes the intensification/diversification paradigm more natural but also greatly simplifies the development effort from the perspective of the practitioner, as one only needs to develop a decoder to map unit random-key vectors to the solution space of the problem on hand. Apart from such key benefits, extensive computational experiments solving real-world problems, such as over-the-air software upgrade scheduling, network design problems, and combinatorial auctions, show that the BRKGA-MP-IPR offers performance benefits over the standard BRKGA as well as the BRKGA with multiple parents.","tags":["Genetic Algorithms","Path-relinking algorithms","Hybrid heuristics"],"title":"The Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with Implicit Path-Relinking and its real-world applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Yuan","Yuning Yang","Carlos E.

This massive growth leads to different levels of complexity, mainly concerned with the assignment of different parameters to antennas or base stations. One parameter is the Root Sequence Index (RSI), related to the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) preambles, used to allocate uplink channels between the user equipment and the base station. The assignment of RSIs close-in-range to neighbor antennas may cause collisions, which are responsible for failures on service establishment, and therefore, performance degradation. Such allocation problems can be modeled as Graph Coloring Problems, including several additional constraints. However, few studies focus on RSI allocation and collisions from the optimization perspective. The objective of this study is to develop a method for allocating the RSI, trying to lessen the risk of collision and obeying other constraints.

In the TMDSP, jobs, machine utilization, and production rates vary over time. In each period, a given job can be executed by a subset of machines with different capacities and production rates. The objective is to deploy a feasible schedule with minimum total completion time.  We explore solving the problem using several approaches among than Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), Simulating Annealing (SA), two variations of Tabu Search (TB), and traditional genetic algorithms (TGA), in addition to a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model.  We test the proposed approaches on a synthetic benchmark and very large real instances in IoT space. While using a commercial solver and the MIP model, we are able to solve only a few real instances (with, at most, 1,976 cars and 9,116 sectors); on the other hand, BRKGA presents significantly better results when compared to ILS, MIP solver and a simple multi-start heuristic.","tags":["Connected Cars","Internet of Things","IoT","Scheduling","Time- and Machine-Dependent Scheduling","Biased random-key genetic algorithm"],"title":"Scheduling software updates for connected cars with limited availability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luciana S.

Using one million connected cars on a production cellular network, we conduct network-scale measurements of over one billion radio connections to understand various aspects including their spatial and temporal connectivity patterns, the network conditions they face, use and handovers across various radio frequencies and mobility patterns. Our measurement study reveals that connected cars have distinct sets of characteristics, including those similar to regular smartphones (e.g. overall diurnal pattern), those similar to IoT devices (e.g. mostly short network sessions), but also some that belong to neither type (e.g. high mobility).

We present a scheduling approach for managing large FOTA downloads in a cellular network that combines historical network load with car usage and location analytics. The proposed approach uses a combination of heuristics and an optimized scheduler and applies them to schedule the admission of cars to download FOTA. Using real network data from a large cellular provider that includes a million cars and nearly a billion radio-level network connections, we show that our scheduling approach is feasible and practical. We also show that it is possible to manage FOTA even when device and network models use high levels of aggregation over time. Simulation results show that our method improves over random uncontrolled approaches by (i) reducing median download startup delay by 48%, (ii) reducing the number of cars that don't complete the update by 10% and most importantly, (iii) reducing the load in busy cells by up to 37%.","tags":["Connected cars","LTE","Firmware over the air"],"title":"Managing massive firmware-over-the-air updates for connected cars in cellular networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

To compare the heuristic solutions, we develop an integer programming formulation which is solved with a branch‐and‐cut algorithm. Capacity and path elimination constraints are added in a cutting plane fashion. The separation algorithms are based on the computation of min‐cut trees and on the connected components of a support graph. Computational experiments were conducted on several benchmark instances of routing problems and show that the heuristics are effective on medium to large‐sized instances, while the branch‐and‐cut algorithm solves small to medium sized problems to optimality.

Candidate Steiner nodes do not have any demand but represent locations where we can install cellsites to cover the traffic and equipment to backhaul the traffic to the cellular core network. Each Steiner node can cover demand nodes within a given distance, subject to a capacity constraint. The aggregate set of constraints may make it impossible to cover or backhaul all demands. A revenue function computes the revenue associated with the total amount of traffic covered and backhauled to the root nodes. The objective of the problem is to build a forest that maximizes the difference between the total revenue and the cost associated with the installed equipment. Although we will have a forest when we consider only the backhaul links and root nodes, the addition of demand vertices can induce undirected cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graph. We consider instances of this problem with several additional constraints that are motivated by the requirements of real-world telecommunication networks.","tags":["Wireless backhaul network design","Small cells","Genetic algorithm","Mixed integer programming model"],"title":"A biased random-key genetic algorithm for wireless backhaul network design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

This winner determination problem assumes that a single bidding round is held to determine both the winners and prices to be paid. We introduce six variants of biased random-key genetic algorithms for this problem. Three of them use a novel initialization technique that makes use of solutions of intermediate linear programming relaxations of an exact mixed integer linear programming model as initial chromosomes of the population. An experimental evaluation compares the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with the standard mixed linear integer programming formulation, a specialized exact algorithm, and the best-performing heuristics proposed for this problem. The proposed algorithms are competitive and offer strong results, mainly for large-scale auctions.","tags":["Combinatorial auctions","Winner determination proble","Genetic algorithms","Biased random-key genetic algorithms"],"title":"Biased random-key genetic algorithms for the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Eduardo de Andrade"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420088400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562075993,"objectID":"49ba4f5db0852f19e33b708fc8dd8a42","permalink":"https://ceandrade.github.io/publication/andrade-2015-evolutionary-algs-telecomm/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/andrade-2015-evolutionary-algs-telecomm/","section":"publication","summary":"In last twenty years, telecommunication networks have experienced a huge increase in data utilization. From massive on-demand video to uncountable mobile devices exchanging text and video, traffic reached scales that overcame the network capacities. Therefore, telecommunication companies around the world have been forced to increase their capacity to serve this increasing demand. As the cost to deploy network infrastructure is usually very large, the design of a network heavily uses optimization tools to keep costs as low as possible. In this thesis, we analyze several aspects of the design and deployment of communication networks.","tags":["Combinatorial Optimization","Network Design","Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms"],"title":"Evolutionary Algorithms for some Problems in Telecommunications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mauro C.

Their optimized resolution leads to great profits in several sectors. A common problem, that occur in textile and paper industries, is to cut a strip of some material to obtain several small items, using the minimum length of material. This problem, known by Two Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2SP), is a hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we present an exact algorithm to 2SP, restricted to two staged cuts (known by Two Dimensional Level Strip Packing, 2LSP). The algorithm uses the branch-and-price technique, and heuristics based on approximation algorithms to obtain upper bounds. The algorithm obtained optimal or almost optimal for small and moderate sized instances.","tags":["Cut and Packing Problem","Branch-and-Price","Column Generation"],"title":"Um algoritmo exato para o Problema de Empacotamento Bidimensional em Faixas","type":"publication"}]
